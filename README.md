## About Me

Hi there, I'm Alejandro Pedraza, I'm from Colombia :colombia:, currently I'm studying 
Software Development at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology.

I am a passionate for developing new things, learn more about this huge world of
codding and programing; even if is a confusing and crazy, everyday you will find
a new way to create something, and you will be proud of yourself.

Unfortunately, I don't have experince in the programming world yet, but I think
that all the knowledge that I'm getting from this program would let me be a 
successful person, and can help others to achieve this things.
